# Cursor self-hosted worker module for Coder templates.
#
# A Cursor-compatible template includes this module and passes it the
# workspace's coder_agent id. It declares every rich parameter
# Agent Relay stamps on a build and runs `agent worker ... start`
# via a coder_script.
#
# Scripts run through coder-utils, which orders the install step before
# the start step and keeps a copy of each script and its output under
# module_directory for debugging.
#
# Parameter contract (enforced by Agent Relay at startup via the dynamic
# parameters evaluate endpoint):
#
#   - agent_relay_session_id, agent_relay_delivery_id, agent_relay_pool,
#     agent_relay_cursor_pool_name, agent_relay_cursor_idle_release_timeout,
#     agent_relay_cursor_repo_url, and agent_relay_cursor_credential_kind
#     are persistent state: coderd only
#     stores parameter values the template declares, and Agent Relay's
#     dedupe and reconciliation query workspaces with `param:` search
#     filters on them. agent_relay_cursor_repo_url is stamped on every
#     build (empty for repo-less pools) so the contract stays static.
#   - agent_relay_credential is an ephemeral worker input, reset between
#     builds.
#
# The worker's lifecycle is published through the agent_relay_status agent
# metadata item, whose script this module renders. The script starts
# the worker detached and exits so the agent reaches the ready
# lifecycle state rather than sitting in starting for the whole
# session.
