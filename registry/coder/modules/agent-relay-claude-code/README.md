# Agent Relay Claude Code

Makes a Coder template a target for [Agent Relay](https://coder.com/docs/ai-coder/agent-relay)
Claude Code pools. Agent Relay dispatches Claude Code sessions to workspaces
built from the template; the module declares the parameters the relay stamps
on each build and runs the Claude Code self-hosted runner.

```tf
module "claude_code_runner" {
  source   = "registry.coder.com/coder/agent-relay-claude-code/coder"
  version  = "0.1.1"
  agent_id = coder_agent.main.id

  # Downloads the Claude Code CLI at start when it is not in the image. Bake
  # the CLI into the image and set this to false for faster workspaces.
  install_cli = true
}

resource "coder_agent" "main" {
  # ...
  metadata {
    key          = "agent_relay_status"
    display_name = "Session"
    script       = module.claude_code_runner.status_metadata_script
    interval     = 10
    timeout      = 5
  }
}
```

The `agent_relay_status` metadata block is required. It has to live on the
`coder_agent`, which the module cannot declare; the relay reads it to decide
when to reap the workspace.

## Requirements

- The `claude` CLI must be in the workspace. `install_cli` (default `true`)
  downloads it at start only when it is not already on PATH; bake it into the
  image for the fastest start. `cli_binary` overrides the path.
- Builds must finish inside Agent Relay's 300s spawn budget: pre-pulled
  images, no persistent volumes.

## Parameters

Agent Relay verifies this contract against the template's active version at
startup and refuses to serve a pool that does not satisfy it. Every parameter
renders disabled with a "Set by Agent Relay on dispatch" placeholder; the
credential is masked.

## Scripts and logs

The module runs two steps through [coder-utils](https://registry.coder.com/modules/coder/coder-utils):
an install step that downloads the CLI when `install_cli` is set and the
binary is missing (a no-op otherwise), then a start step that launches the
runner. Everything lands under `$HOME/.coder-modules/coder/agent-relay-claude-code`:

| path           | contents                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/*.sh` | the install and start scripts as they ran       |
| `logs/*.log`   | output of each step, plus the runner's own log  |
| `runner-state` | the supervisor's lifecycle line (`state_file`)  |
| `supervise.sh` | the detached supervisor that owns the runner    |
| `wrapper.sh`   | session wrapper that forces `bypassPermissions` |

## Runner lifecycle

The start step launches `claude self-hosted-runner --capacity 1 --exit-if-unused-min 10` detached and exits,
so the agent reaches `ready` immediately. The runner is wrapped so every
session runs with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`; there is no terminal
attached, so an approval prompt would hang it. When the runner exits, Agent
Relay deletes the workspace; when it fails, the relay nacks the work order.
A runner that is never assigned its session exits after `exit_if_unused_min`
minutes (default 10, 0 to disable), so a dispatch that never arrives is reaped
rather than reporting `working` forever.

`agent_relay_status` reports one of:

| value             | meaning                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`         | no state recorded yet                                                      |
| `idle`            | no credential: workspace was created manually                              |
| `working`         | runner alive, no session picked up                                         |
| `serving`         | runner alive, session picked up (best effort, see `serving_log_pattern`)   |
| `orphaned`        | runner process gone without recording an exit                              |
| `done <code>`     | runner exited with that status; `137` means it was killed                  |
| `failed <reason>` | runner could not start, e.g. `runner-agent-missing` when the CLI is absent |

Renaming the `agent_relay_status` key breaks reaping.
